# Diagnostic Workflow: Automated Mass Spectrometry Imaging Analysis on Formalin-Fixed and Paraffin Embedded Breast Cancer Tissue Samples 

This is the repository for the paper "Diagnostic Workflow: Automated Mass Spectrometry Imaging Analysis on Formalin-Fixed and Paraffin Embedded Breast Cancer Tissue Samples". 


## Deep Learning
### Pre-processing of training data (WSI)
For the pre-processing of the training data, the default pipeline presented in the paper "Giunchiglia, V., McKenzie, J., and Takats Z., "WSIQC: whole slide imagesâ€™ pre-processing pipeline for quality control assessment and AI-based data analysis", in preparation, 2021" was used. The code is avaialble at this link https://github.com/valegiunchiglia/wsi_pre_processing.

### Pre-processing of test data (TMA FFPE)
