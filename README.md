# Automated cancer diagnostics via analysis of optical and chemical images by deep and shallow learning


This is the repository for the paper "Automated cancer diagnostics via analysis of optical and chemical images by deep and shallow learning". 


## Deep Learning
### Pre-processing of training data (WSI)
For the pre-processing of the training data, the default pipeline presented in the paper "Giunchiglia, V., McKenzie, J., and Takats Z., "WSIQC: whole slide imagesâ€™ pre-processing pipeline for quality control assessment and AI-based data analysis", in preparation, 2022" was used. The code will be avaialble at this link https://github.com/valegiunchiglia/wsi_pre_processing. 

### Pre-processing of test data (TMA FFPE)
The main pre-processing steps of FFPE images were:
1. Automated splitting of the TMA image into patches each containing one core
2. Detection and removal of the background from high resolution images
3. Tiling of high resolution images
4. Selection of the tiles containing less than a specific propotion of background
5. Preparation of the dictionaries to input into the neural network

# Basic usage
```
# First command pre-processing pipeline

python3 confusion_matrix_ffpe.py \
  --path_to_slides [path/to/output/images] \
  --output [path/to/output/directory] \
  --output_h5 [path/to/output/directory/h5files]
 
Optional arguments:
--thresh_back                Upper threshold of proportion of background allowed in a tile
--tile_size                  Size of tiles extracted from the Whole Slide Image


# First command for the calculation of performance metrics

python3 confusion_matrix_ffpe.py \
  --path_to_predictions [path/to/output/predictions] \
  --test_dictionary [path/to/test/dictionary] \
  --output [path/to/output/directory] \
  --path_to_images [path/to/output/images]
 
 The shape of the test_dictionary must be the following:
